Hey Im Cooper LKZ
im new to coding I have 0 experiance at the time of starting this but plan on learning everything I can about codeing strictly for Blockchain purposes
I 100% believe that if you dont know how to code in this Era you are behind so I am dedicating myself out of my comfort zone to understand and ask questions no matter how begginer they are
I am a crypto investor and the more I learn about crypto the more I want to be able to operate in the space. It has always been something that isnt Tangible to me and others around me but I believe through Codeing that will be a thing of the past.
Thanks for reading this -> goodluck and lets work towards Finacial Freedom
